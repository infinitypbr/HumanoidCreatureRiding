# HumanoidCreatureRiding
This is an area for code that allows humanoid characters to ride creatures in game.

The goal is to allow any Humanoid (such as the Human Fantasy Pack PBR) to ride any creature (such as the Dragons Pack PBR).  While the end result should work with the InfinityPBR models, I would hope that it can also work with any models produced by anyone else.

The code is free to use by anyone for anything.

WHY I STARTED THIS
I couldn't figure it out myself.  I tried working with someone via Unity Connect, but that didn't work out so well, and I lost some money in the process without any solid solution that actually worked.  I'm well aware that many of you are more capable to figure this out, so I'm hoping to learn from you and work with you on an ideal solution.
